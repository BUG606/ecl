<h2>CVS repository</h2>

<p>Beginning on March, ECL partially moved to the common-lisp.net
server. If you keep up to date with the latest improvements and fixes of
the ECL environment, you can use CVS to pull the latest sources from
there.

<p>If you have a modern version of the CVS program, such as the one
shipped with Mingw or with any Linux distribution, the command to get
the development sources is
<pre>
# ADDRESS=anonymous@common-lisp.net:/project/ecl/cvsroot
# cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous:$ADDRESS co ecl
</pre>
<p>Additionally you can test ECL with Paul Dietz's ANSI test
suite. For that you need to download some additional files using
<pre>
# cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous:$ADDRESS co ecl-test
</pre>
<p>Typing <tt>make</tt> from the top of the <tt>ecl-test</tt>
directory will download the latest version of the test suite and run
it using the version of ECL which is available on your machine.

<h2>Browsing CVS</h2>

<p>Additionally you can browse the ECL source code and download
tarballs using <a
href="http://common-lisp.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/?root=ecl">this address</a>.
