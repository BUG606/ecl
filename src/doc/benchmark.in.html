<h2>Benchmark</h2>

Benchmarks should be taken with a grain of salt. <a
href="http://ecls.sourceforge.net">ECLS</a> does not aim to compete with any
commercial or open source implementation. The purpose of these benchmarks are,
thus, to show the progress of <a href="http://ecls.sourceforge.net">ECLS</a>
itself from version to version.

<p>It also serves to show how well other implementations perform: CLISPc, which
is based on bytecodes, is astonishingly fast, compared to other bytecodes
implementations (ECLSi, CMUCLi) and to native code implementations (ECLSc,
CMUCLc).

<p>All benchmarks are executed one after another. The benchmark currently shows
just mean execution times in seconds, using English decimal point (0.03 = 3/100
seconds).  This means that performance of garbage collectors has a deep impact
in these numbers.

<p>It would be nice to collect some other information, such as memory use and
garbage collector timings, but that is beyond my reach for now. Help is always
welcome.

<p>Finally, I have decided to distribute Gabriel's benchmarks together with <a
href="http://ecls.sourceforge.net">ECLS</a>. The reason is that this code seems
to belong to public domain and I had to perform several changes in order to let
it run with different implementations. To recreate the benchmark just get in
<tt>build/gabriel/</tt> and type <tt>make</tt>.
