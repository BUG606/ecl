<h2>News in this release (ECL-@VERSION@)</h2>
<pre>
* Supported platforms:

  - ECL now compiles and runs in static mode under MacOSX.

* Errors fixed:

  - Code for handling :IMPORT-FROM in DEFPACKAGE was bogus

  - The arguments of GENSYM should not be remembered by ECLS. The
    current behaviour was wrong:
		> (gensym)
		#:G36
		> (gensym "F")
		#:F37
		> (gensym)
		#:F38

* System design:

  - Function SI:NANI has been removed. Its purpose was to provide an
    object which could not be printed or readed so that it could be
    used to mark unbound slots in classes. Now the function SI:UNBOUND
    performs the same task.

  - Mathematical functions which deal with matisas, exponents, etc,
    now make use of the ISO-C99 facilities which are almost
    everywhere.

  - Global function pointer output_ch_fun and read_ch_fun
    disappear. Now the differences between ordinary streams and CLOS
    streams are handled in file.d. Optimizations for synonym streams
    also disappear from read.d and print.d.

  - All information used by FORMAT is kept in stack-allocated
    structures. Now FORMAT is reentrant and can be safely called from
    within PRINT-OBJECT.

  - Most symbols belonging to the LISP package and to the C core, are
    kept in a single array, "cl_symbols". The translator "dpp" and the
    routine SI::MANGLE-NAME, output the right name for any symbol
    which is in this array.

  - ECL relies fully on the Boehm-Weiser garbage collector
    (v. 6.1). The old garbage collector is known to reclaim too much
    data, resulting in heap corruption. Help is welcome on this field.

  - The headers of the Boehm-Weiser garbage collector are installed
    together with ECL.

* Visible changes and ANSI compatibility:

  - New configuration flag --with-clos-streams, enables the user to
    define CLOS objects which behave as lisp streams. Such object must
    have the following methods defined: STREAM-INPUT-P,
    STREAM-OUTPUT-P, STREAM-READ-CHAR, STREAM-UNREAD-CHAR,
    STREAM-LISTEN, STREAM-CLEAR-INPUT, STREAM-WRITE-CHAR,
    STREAM-CLEAR-OUTPUT, STREAM-FORCE-OUTPUT, STREAM-CLOSE.

  - LOAD accepts now a stream as input parameter. However, in this
    case it only tolerates lisp source files, not compiled files or
    libraries. For example, (LOAD (OPEN "foo.lsp")) is equivalent
    to (LOAD "foo.lsp").

  - ECL now uses a hashtable to store objects when *PRINT-CIRCLE* is
    on. This hashtable is not cleared when calling PRINT-OBJECT, so
    that circularities are also detected inside these methods.

  - *PRINT-CIRCLE* defaults to NIL.

<h2>Known bugs</h2>

As I mentioned above, the problem I am finding here is the lack of test suites
which I can use to detect failures in the behavior of any function. Currently I
can assure that <a href="http://ecls.sourceforge.net">ECL</a> passes most of
the tests from the <a href="http://clocc.sourceforge.net">the CLOCC suite</a>.
The most important exceptions are
<ul>
<li>CLOS
<li>#'format
<li>#'unread-char is too lax
<li>The CL package is too polluted
<li>Support for logical pathnames is incomplete
</ul>

If you find something that should be fixed or that the behavior of a
function is particularly misleading with respect to the standards, feel free
to tell me so.

Some other bugs which need to be fixed are:
<ul>
<li>Sockets haven't been tested yet.
<li>Threads were broken with latest improvements.
<li>#'format doesn't pass the Cltl-1 tests.
<li>Needs better support for wildcards in pathnames.
<li>Support for CLOS needs yet more optimization.
<li>ECL has its own pretty-printer, which does not conform ANSI.
</ul>
