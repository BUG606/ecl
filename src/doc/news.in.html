<h2>News in this release (ECLS-@VERSION@)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Due to human errors, the bytecompiler shipped with 0.1a was an
  unfinished version. In 0.1b we shipped a more polished files. Some
  of the errors which are fixed are
  <ul>
  <li>Produce the right code for TAGBODY inside closures</li>
  <li>Activate compiler for SYMBOL-MACROLET</li>
  <li>Allow non-keyword symbols as lambda-list-keywords</li>
  <li>Allow more than one :ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS to be supplied, but discard other than the first one
  <li> Process declarations in FLET/LABELS forms
  </ul>

<li> Fixed the C compiler routines for TAGBODY: it would produce wrong
  code when jumping out of a closure.

<li> Rewrite the error system using KMP's condition system, CLOS and a
  rudimentary interface to the toplevel.

<li> Enclosing the bytecompiler in an UNWIND-PROTECT ensures that the
  status of the compiler and of the interpreter is always consistent.

<li> Port and incorporate Peter Van Eynde's test suite for ANSI
  compliance.

<li> Replace features ECL/ECL-MIN with ECLS and ECLS-MIN. All references
  to ECL (Eco-Common-Lisp) should have been dropped by now.

<li> Add simple-program-error and simple-control-error to the hierarchy
  of conditions, and try to ensure that all routines in libecls.a
  signal the right type of condition.

<li> Define COMPLEMENT and CONTINOUSLY.

<li> Fix #'= between bignums.

<li> NIL is no longer valid as the first of a pair of bounding index
  designators, i.e. (nstring-upcase "aa" :start nil :end nil) causes
  an error.
</ul>

<h2>Known bugs</h2>

As I mentioned above, the problem I am finding here is the lack of test suites
which I can use to detect failures in the behavior of any function. Currently I
can assure that <a href="http://ecls.sourceforge.net">ECLS</a> passes most of
the tests from the <a href="http://clocc.sourceforge.net">the CLOCC suite</a>.
The most important exceptions are
<ul>
<li>CLOS
<li>#'format
<li>#'unread-char is too lax
<li>The CL package is too polluted
<li>LOOP lacks some of the standard keywords, including destructuring
<li>Support for logical pathnames is incomplete
</ul>

If you find something that should be fixed or that the behavior of a
function is particularly misleading with respect to the standards, feel free
to tell me so.

Some other bugs which need to be fixed are:
<ul>
<li>Threads and sockets haven't been tested yet.
<li>#'format doesn't pass the Cltl-1 tests and fails when the number of
arguments is large.
<li>Needs better support for wildcards in pathnames.
<li>Bugs in logical operations among bignums.
<li>Support for CLOS needs yet more optimization.
</ul>
