<h2>Known bugs</h2>

As I mentioned above, the problem I am finding here is the lack of test suites
which I can use to detect failures in the behavior of any function. Currently I
can assure that <a href="http://ecls.sourceforge.net">ECL</a> passes most of
the tests from the <a href="http://clocc.sourceforge.net">the CLOCC suite</a>.
The most important exceptions are
<ul>
<li>CLOS
<li>#'format
<li>#'unread-char is too lax
<li>Support for logical pathnames is incomplete
<li>No support for (SETF (VALUES ...) ...)
</ul>

If you find something that should be fixed or that the behavior of a
function is particularly misleading with respect to the standards, feel free
to tell me so.

Some other bugs which need to be fixed are:
<ul>
<li>Threads were broken with latest improvements.
<li>#'format doesn't pass the Cltl-1 tests.
<li>Support for CLOS needs yet more optimization.
<li>ECL has its own pretty-printer, which does not conform ANSI.
</ul>
