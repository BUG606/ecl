<h2>News in this release (ECLS-@VERSION@)</h2>

<ul>
<li> Errors fixed:
<ul>
<li> The dynamic linker in eval.d (link_call) truncated addresses
    larger than MOST_POSITIVE_FIXNUM.

<li> The routine that outputs addresses as hexadecimal numbers, and
    which is used in print-unreadable, would only output the first
    digit.

<li> Make sure that the proclamations in Gabriel's benchmark are
    evaluated at compile time, too.

<li> Fix the native compiler and the bytecodes compiler so that when
    they finds LOCALLY, MACROLET or SYMBOL-MACROLET at the top level,
    it processes their bodies as top level forms as well. For
    instance, this now works:
	(LOCALLY (EVAL-WHEN (:COMPILE-TOPLEVEL) (PRINT "HELLO")))
</ul>
<li> Add name mangling to ECLS:
<ul>
<li> In the preprocessed files (*.d) @package::symbol can be used to
    refer to a lisp function, while @'package::symbol can be used to
    refer to a lisp symbol. The preprocessor translates these names
    into valid C names.

<li> Function SI::MANGLE-NAME returns the C name for a lisp symbol
    or function, and tells whether that symbol has been defined as
    external C function already.

<li> A new proclamation
	(proclaim '(si::c-export-fname union))
    advises the lisp->C translator to produce a C function with
    mangle named (clLunion in this case), that can be directly called
    from other translated files and from user written code.
</ul>
<li> Visible changes and ANSI compatibility:
<ul>
<li> Remove variable si::*system-directory* and use logical hostname
    "SYS:" instead.

<li> Remove *EVALHOOK*, *APPLYHOOK*, #'EVALHOOK and #'APPLYHOOK, which
    make little sense when working in a early compilation environment.

<li> Stepper removed until we figure out how to implement this using
    the bytecodes.

<li> The library function eval() now accepts an environment as a third
    parameter. On top of this function, SI:EVAL-WITH-ENV, evaluates
    a form on a given environment.

<li> New accessor ROW-MAJOR-AREF.
</ul>
<li> System design and portability:
</ul>
<li> Code has been revised so that it works in environments where stack
    grows upwards, as well as in environments where the parameters to
    a function cannot be accessed as an array and only va_list/va_arg
    work.

<li> Implement loading of object files using the native "dlopen"
    function which is present in most operating systems. Support for
    "dld" has been dropped and the whole of the CRS library has been
    removed

<li> Remove use of alloca() when printing circular structures. In a
    near future, use of alloca() should be dropped completely.
</ul>

<h2>Known bugs</h2>

As I mentioned above, the problem I am finding here is the lack of test suites
which I can use to detect failures in the behavior of any function. Currently I
can assure that <a href="http://ecls.sourceforge.net">ECLS</a> passes most of
the tests from the <a href="http://clocc.sourceforge.net">the CLOCC suite</a>.
The most important exceptions are
<ul>
<li>CLOS
<li>#'format
<li>#'unread-char is too lax
<li>The CL package is too polluted
<li>LOOP lacks some of the standard keywords, including destructuring
<li>Support for logical pathnames is incomplete
</ul>

If you find something that should be fixed or that the behavior of a
function is particularly misleading with respect to the standards, feel free
to tell me so.

Some other bugs which need to be fixed are:
<ul>
<li>Threads and sockets haven't been tested yet.
<li>#'format doesn't pass the Cltl-1 tests and fails when the number of
arguments is large.
<li>Needs better support for wildcards in pathnames.
<li>Bugs in logical operations among bignums.
<li>Support for CLOS needs yet more optimization.
</ul>
