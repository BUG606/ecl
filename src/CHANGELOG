ECL 9.5:
========

* MOP:

 - CALL-METHOD has only one required argument. Affects only calls to this
   macro inside nonstandard method combinations.

* Visible changes:

 - Physical pathnames do not always have a namestring from which they can be
   reconstructed. This is the case of directory pathnames with version numbers,
   for instance. Formerly ECL would refuse to print those pathnames if
   *PRINT-READABLY* was true, but now it uses instead a #. form.
