ECL 0.9i
========

* Visible changes:

 - Many functions have got now the prefix "ecl_" so as to avoid namespace
   collisions with C/C++ code.

 - Several functions with duplicate functionality (make_two_way_streams,
   make_string_output_stream_from_string, close_stream, etc) have been removed.

 - A new global variable EXT:*ACTION-ON-UNDEFINED-VARIABLE* controls whether
   the interpreter complains when you try to assign a value to a symbol that
   has not been defined as variable. An example

	> (SETQ S 1)	; No complain
	1
	> (SETQ EXT:*ACTION-ON-UNDEFINED-VARIABLE* 'ERROR)
	ERROR
	> (SETQ X 1)	; Ooops, X had not been defined before!
	Undefined variable referenced in interpreted code.
	Name: X
	>> :q
	> (DEFVAR X 1)
	X
	> (SETQ X 1)
	1

 - Adding a new method to a generic function does no longer result in a warning
   when the function belongs to a locked package.
