ECL 1.0
=======

* Errors fixed:

  - Under unix-like systems, relative symbolink links (such as the ones
    produced by "ln -sf ../tmp/foo faa") are now properly recognized and
    followed by TRUENAME.

  - The routines for writing bignums had a size limit that has been
    removed. Besides the library does not rely on GMP for printing bignums.

  - PEEK-CHAR works now for concatenated streams (M.Goffioul)

  - Fixes in the documentation and error messages (J. Stecklina)

* Visible changes:

  - SI:MKSTEMP now accepts and returns pathnames.

  - A new logical hostname TMP points to a suitable directory for temporary
    files. The value is guessed using environment variables TMPDIR, TEMP and
    TMP. In some systems this directory might need to have execution
    permissions.

  - Automatic deletion of DLLs under the MSVC port.

  - ECL now checks whether the lambda list of a DEFMETHOD is compatible in
    length with a previously specified one.

* ANSI compliance:

  - The value of *READTABLE* can now be modified by the user.

  - Implemented READTABLE-CASE, including the appropiate changes to the
    reader and the printer.

  - Floats are properly read even when *read-base* is not 10.
