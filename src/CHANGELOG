ECL 12.2.2:
===========

* Bugs fixed:

 - The implementation of locks and condition variables based on POSIX threads
   was not safe under interrupts. It has all been reimplemented using atomic
   userspace operations plus a new wait queue.

* Visible changes:

 - DIRECTORY no longer complains when it finds an inexistent directory
   component: it simply returns NIL as the list of pathnames.

 - CASE now complains when the OTHERWISE/T clause is not the last one.

 - Instead of issuing an error, LOOP now only produces a STYLE-WARNING
   when iteration forms appear at the wrong place, as in (LOOP WHILE ...)
   followed by some assignment.

 - EXT:MKDIR no longer accepts pathnames as inputs to avoid problems with
   pathnames that contain name or type components.

 - ENSURE-DIRECTORIES-EXIST accepts the keyword argument :MODE which is
   passed to MKDIR.
