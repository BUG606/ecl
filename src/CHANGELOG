ECL 12.2.2:
===========

* Bugs fixed:

 - The implementation of locks and condition variables based on POSIX threads
   was not safe under interrupts. It has all been reimplemented using atomic
   userspace operations plus a new wait queue.

 - :CDECL was not accepted as an FFI declaration due to a typo.

 - REMOVE-METHOD and FIND-METHOD were not generic functions.

* Visible changes:

 - DIRECTORY no longer complains when it finds an inexistent directory
   component: it simply returns NIL as the list of pathnames.

 - CASE now complains when the OTHERWISE/T clause is not the last one.

 - Instead of issuing an error, LOOP now only produces a STYLE-WARNING
   when iteration forms appear at the wrong place, as in (LOOP WHILE ...)
   followed by some assignment.

 - EXT:MKDIR no longer accepts pathnames as inputs to avoid problems with
   pathnames that contain name or type components.

 - ENSURE-DIRECTORIES-EXIST accepts the keyword argument :MODE which is
   passed to MKDIR.

* Metaobject protocol:

 - Implemented CLOS:COMPUTE-APPLICABLE-METHODS-USING-CLASSES.

 - COMPUTE-APPLICABLE-METHODS and CLOS:COMPUTE-EFFECTIVE-METHOD are now
   generic functions.

 - Implemented and used in the core: VALIDATE-SUPERCLASSES

 - UPDATE-DEPENDENT, MAP-DEPENDENTS and related functions have been fixed. They
   are now invoked by REMOVE-METHOD and REINITIALIZE-INSTANCE, when acting on
   generic functions, standard classes, etc.

 - (SETF CLASS-NAME) is now implemented using REINITIALIZE-INSTANCE.

 - ENSURE-CLASS-USING-CLASS now registers the class with
   FIND-CLASS. ENSURE-CLASS relies on E-C-U-C doing that.

 - EXTRACT-LAMBDA-LIST and EXTRACT-SPECIALIZER-NAMES implemented.
