ECL 9.9.1:
==========

* Visible changes:

 - When embedded, ECL may coexist with code that uses the GMP library in
   different ways, and sometimes that code may use different memory allocation
   routines. In order to solve this problem ECL introduces a new option,
   ECL_OPT_SET_GMP_MEMORY_FUNCTIONS, which determines whether GMP will use the
   Boehm-Weiser garbage collector to allocate memory or not.

 - The previous change also implies that ECL must do all bignum computations
   using GMP-allocated numbers that are then automatically freed. More
   precisely, this is done using big_register[0-2]_get() and
   big_register_normalize() everywhere and operating destructively on those
   numbers. These functions have been made aware of the fact that GMP may
   use other allocation routines and always call mpz_clear() to free memory.
