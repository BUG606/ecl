ECL 0.9k:
=========

* Visible changes:

 - The documentation is slowly disappearing form this source tree, as there
   is a different tree (ecl-doc) which contains the XML sources for a more
   complete manual.

 - RENAME-FILE now accepts a keyword argument :IF-EXISTS, which defines the
   behavior when a file with the new name already exists (Geo Carncross).
