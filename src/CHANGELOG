ECL 0.9f
========

* Errors fixed:

 - The reader macros for lists, ##, #C, #P and #' did not behave as expected
   when *read-suppress* = t.

 - No comments were allowed between the last list element and the parenthesis
   in a dotted lists. In other words, this:
	(1 . 2 ;; just a comment
	)
   produced an error.

 - In compiled code, discarded (VALUES ...) forms did not trigger all the
   required unwinding forms, so that (TAGBODY (CATCH 'FOO (VALUES 0))) produced
   wrong code.

 - In compiled code, the init-form for keyword and optional arguments could
   reference the variable that it was going to initialize, as in
	(LAMBDA (&OPTIONAL (FOO (1+ FOO))) ...)

* Visible changes:

 - Multithreaded ECL now in Windows, either with Microsoft VC++
   or Mingw32 (M. Goffioul).

 - Improvements in the efficiency of macro readers for #a() and #()

 - When supplied an :INITIAL-CONTENTS, MAKE-ARRAY now uses a more efficient
   algorithm.

 - Optimized some routines that iterate over sequences: SOME, EVERY,
   NOTANY, NOTEVERY (M. Goffioul)

 - A new global variable SI::*EXIT-HOOKS* is used to store closures that
   will be invoked when exiting ECL by cl_shutdown().

 - Slight rewrite of configuration help.

 - Configure option --with-clos-streams now defaults to true.

* ANSI Compatibility:

 - DEFSETF forms are enclosed in a block with the name of the accessor.

 - When supplied a compiled function as second argument, COMPILE returns
   this function. And also when the function is interpreted but we have
   lost its original definition.

 - Now an error is signaled for unmatched parenthesis as in "(1 2 3))".
   The only exception is in the toplevel, where only a warning is issued.

 - The stream argument for DESCRIBE-OBJECT is now a required one, instead of
   an optional.

 - When *PRINT-READABLY*=T, vectors just print as arrays.

* Contributed modules:

 - MIT test unit rt.lisp is now available as #p"sys:rt"

 - SBCL sockets have been ported to unix (J. Stecklina) and to windows
   (M. Goffioul) and are built when using the configuration option --with-tcp.
   Both INET and Unix sockets are implemented, although under windows the
   latter must be simulated using pipes.
