ECL 12.2.2:
===========

* Bugs fixed:

 - The implementation of locks and condition variables based on POSIX threads
   was not safe under interrupts. It has all been reimplemented using atomic
   userspace operations plus a new wait queue.

* Visible changes:

 - DIRECTORY no longer complains when it finds an inexistent directory
   component: it simply returns NIL as the list of pathnames.
