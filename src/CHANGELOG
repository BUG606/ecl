ECL 0.9l-p1:
============

* Bugs fixed:

 - The optimizer for COERCE might enter an infinite loop for certain
   type intervals.

 - The sharp macros #n# and #n=... did not work well with arrays of an
   specialized type.

 - Deactivate --enable-asmapply by default, because it is still an experimental
   feature.
