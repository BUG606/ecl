========

* Design:

 - Simplified the structure of the frame stack, removing redundant fields.

 - Reworked the structure of the lexical environment to accelerate access to
   variables.

 - New hash routine, similar to SBCL's one, faster and leading to fewer
   collisions between similar strings.
