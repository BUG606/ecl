ECL 0.9f
========

* Errors fixed:

 - The reader macros for lists, ##, #C, #P and #' did not behave as expected
   when *read-suppress* = t.

 - No comments were allowed between the last list element and the parenthesis
   in a dotted lists. In other words, this:
	(1 . 2 ;; just a comment
	)
   produced an error.

* Visible changes:

 - Improvements in the efficiency of macro readers for #a() and #()

 - When supplied an :INITIAL-CONTENTS, MAKE-ARRAY now uses a more efficient
   algorithm.

 - Optimized some routines that iterate over sequences: SOME, EVERY,
   NOTANY, NOTEVERY (M. Goffioul)

* ANSI Compatibility:

 - DEFSETF forms are enclosed in a block with the name of the accessor.

 - When supplied a compiled function as second argument, COMPILE returns
   this function. And also when the function is interpreted but we have
   lost its original definition.

 - Now an error is signaled for unmatched parenthesis as in "(1 2 3))".
   The only exception is in the toplevel, where only a warning is issued.

 - The stream argument for DESCRIBE-OBJECT is now a required one, instead of
   an optional.
