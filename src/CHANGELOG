ECL 13.7.1
==========

* Errors fixed:

- DEFUN functions not defined as toplevel forms were also directly referenced
  other code in the same file.

* Extensions:

- In compiled code it is possible to declare variables to have a C type
  such as in (declare (:double a)) and then the variable is enforced to
  be unboxed to such type.

;;; Local Variables: ***
;;; mode:text ***
;;; fill-column:79 ***
;;; End: ***
