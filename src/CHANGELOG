ECL 0.9k:
=========

* Visible changes:

 - The documentation is slowly disappearing form this source tree, as there
   is a different tree (ecl-doc) which contains the XML sources for a more
   complete manual.

 - RENAME-FILE now accepts a keyword argument :IF-EXISTS, which defines the
   behavior when a file with the new name already exists (Geo Carncross).

 - Improved hashing on 64-bit machines.

 - The physical pathname format has changed from [device:][[//hostname]/]...
   to [[device:[//hostname]]/]... The reason is that this allows proper
   parsing of Unix pathnames such as "//usr/".

 - In interpreted functions, blocks are only created when used. The current
   algorithm for detecting unused blocks is inefficient, with a performance
   penalty 2^{# unused blocks}, but this seems to pay off when running the
   interpreted code, due to decreased consing
	> (defun foo () )         
	FOO
	> (time (dotimes (i 100000) (foo)))
	real time : 0.045 secs
	run time  : 0.048 secs
	gc count  : 1 times
	consed    : 160 bytes
   Formerly, this would cons 3200192 bytes.


* CLOS:

 - When caching generic function calls, ECL now uses a thread-local hash table
   instead of one hash table per generic function.

* Bugs fixed:

 - The bignums produced by RANDOM did not have enough random bits.

 - ECL formerly accepted spaces between the comma and the @ and . characters
   in expressions like ,@ or ,.
