ECL 0.9l-p1:
============

* Bugs fixed:

 - The optimizer for COERCE might enter an infinite loop for certain
   type intervals.

 - The sharp macros #n# and #n=... did not work well with arrays of an
   specialized type.

 - Deactivate --enable-asmapply by default, because it is still an experimental
   feature.

 - In compiled files, externalize package objects using FIND-PACKAGE.

 - In RUN-PROGRAM, there were two bugs: first, the keyword :WAIT was not
   defined in the C core and caused an error when used; second, if the output
   stream was missing or directed to the standard output, it would fail.
