Announcement of ECL v0.9d
=========================

ECL stands for Embeddable Common-Lisp. The ECL project is an effort to
modernize Giuseppe Attardi's ECL (ECoLisp) environment to produce an
implementation of the Common-Lisp language which complies to the ANSI
X3J13 definition of the language.

ECL supports the operating systems Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris,
Windows/Cygwin and OSX, running on top of the Intel, Sparc, Alpha and PowerPC
processors. Porting to other architectures should be rather easy.

ECL is currently hosted at SourceForge. The home page of the project
is http://ecls.sourceforge.net, and in it you will find source code
releases, a CVS tree and an up to date documentation.

Notes for this release
======================

This release add support for compiling lisp code as shared libraries under the
OSX operating system, and makes ECL compile and run again under Solaris/Sparc,
now using 64-bit pointers/fixnums when available.
