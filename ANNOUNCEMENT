Announcement of ECL v8.12.0
===========================

ECL stands for Embeddable Common-Lisp. The ECL project aims to produce an
implementation of the Common-Lisp language which complies to the ANSI X3J13
definition of the language.

The term embeddable refers to the fact that ECL includes a lisp to C compiler,
which produces libraries (static or dynamic) that can be called from C
programs. Furthermore, ECL can produce standalone executables from your lisp
code and can itself be linked to your programs as a shared library.

ECL supports the operating systems Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris (at
least v. 9), Microsoft Windows and OSX, running on top of the Intel, Sparc,
Alpha and PowerPC processors. Porting to other architectures should be rather
easy.

ECL is currently hosted at Common-Lisp.net and SourceForge. The home page of
the project is http://ecls.sourceforge.net, and in it you will find source code
releases, a CVS tree and some useful documentation.


Notes for this release
======================

This release is the last one before a major redesign of ECL, which will affect
issues like Unicode streams and handling of interrupts.

This is also the first one to follow the new numbering scheme, inspired by that
of Ubuntu. The release number follows the scheme year.month.[0-9], where the
last digit marks the patch release. The numbering is now incorporated in the
library names, so that different versions of ECL may coexit on the same system.
