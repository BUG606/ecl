ECL stands for Embeddable Common-Lisp. The ECL project aims to
produce an implementation of the Common-Lisp language which complies
to the ANSI X3J13 definition of the language.
  
The term embeddable refers to the fact that ECL includes a lisp to C
compiler, which produces libraries (static or dynamic) that can be
called from C programs. Furthermore, ECL can produce standalone
executables from your lisp code and can itself be linked to your
programs as a shared library.
  
ECL supports the operating systems Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
Solaris (at least v. 9), Microsoft Windows and OSX, running on top of
the Intel, Sparc, Alpha, ARM and PowerPC processors.  Porting to other
architectures should be rather easy.
