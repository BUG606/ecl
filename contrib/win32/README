In this directory you will find an interesting example of an application built
using ECL's implementation of the UFFI specification.

This example consists on several files:

 * win32.lsp: This is a lisp interface to the Microsoft Windows API
   for the graphical user interface. It is not finished but it suffices
   to demonstrate the most important ingredients you will need in a
   real-world application.

 * txtedit.lsp: A simple text editor written using the previous library.

 * compile-and-run.lsp: This lisp script builds the Win32 library and
   runs the text editor using it.

This library has been contributed by Michael Goffioul (michael dot goffioul at
swing dot be). Feel free to experiment with it and share your experience at
the ECL mailing list.
